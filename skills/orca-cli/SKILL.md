description: >-
  Operate Orca-managed worktrees, folder contexts, terminals, repos, automations, artifacts,
  skill sharing, worktree comments, and Orca's embedded browser through the `orca` CLI. Use
  when the user says "$orca-cli", "Orca worktree", "child worktree", "spawn codex/claude in a
  worktree", "read/wait/send Orca terminal", "handoff" / "handover" / "give this to another
  agent", "Orca browser", "orca artifacts", or "share skills". Prefer it over raw git
  worktree, ad hoc PTYs, or Computer Use when Orca state is involved. Use Computer Use only
  for external windows or desktop UI that needs OS-level control, and Playwright or CDP for
  external pages.

# Orca CLI

This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide. The full, version-matched Orca CLI
reference is served by the `orca` binary itself — kept out of this file on purpose so it
can never drift from the binary that will actually run your commands.

Engage Orca whenever its running editor/runtime is the source of truth: Orca-managed
worktrees, folder contexts, terminals, repos, automations, worktree comments, and the
browser embedded inside the Orca app. Triggers include "$orca-cli", "Orca worktree",
"child worktree", "spawn codex/claude in a worktree", "read/wait/send Orca terminal",
"full handoff" / "handover" / "give this to another agent", and "control the browser
inside Orca". Use plain shell tools when Orca state does not matter.

## Resolve the CLI for this session

Choose the executable once and reuse it for every later command:

- If the `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` environment variable is set, use its value. Orca exports this
  for managed WSL sessions.
- Otherwise, in a dev checkout whose session exposes `ORCA_DEV_REPO_ROOT`, use `orca-dev`.
- Otherwise, on Linux outside an Orca-managed terminal, use `orca-ide`. Never run bare
  `orca` there — outside Orca's terminals it normally resolves to the
  GNOME Orca screen reader (`/usr/bin/orca`) and starts speech on the user's machine.
- Otherwise, use `orca`.

Below, `ORCA` is a placeholder for the executable you resolved. Substitute it before
running anything; do not create a shell variable or run `ORCA` literally. This works the
same way in POSIX shells, PowerShell, and cmd.exe.

If the selected executable cannot run, report its exact error and stop. Do not fall through
to another executable, which could silently target a different Orca build.

## Load the full guide before running Orca commands

```text
ORCA skills get orca-cli
```

That prints the complete, version-matched guide for the exact binary that will handle your
next commands — worktrees, handoffs, terminals, automations, and the built-in browser.
Read it first, then run the specific command you need.

Don't guess subcommands or flags from memory or from a cached copy of this stub. They change
between Orca releases, and this file deliberately no longer lists them. Prefer `--json` for
agent-driven calls. If a command reports that Orca is not running, start it with `ORCA open
--json` and retry. If the binary does not recognize `skills get`, it predates this guide:
tell the user that updating Orca restores it, and ask before running anything else.
