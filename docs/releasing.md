# Releasing Orca

## Release Process

Version bumps, tags, and releases are maintainer-managed. Do not include release version changes in a normal contribution unless a maintainer asks for them.

### Cutting a release (maintainers)

All releases are cut from the **Cut Release** GitHub Actions workflow. There is no local `pnpm release:*` script — running releases locally is too easy to get wrong (dirty tree, wrong branch, stale main).

**To cut a release:**

1. Open [Actions → Cut Release](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/actions/workflows/release-cut.yml).
2. Click **Run workflow** and pick:
   - **kind**: one of `rc`, `patch`, `minor`, `major`.
   - **ref**: the branch, tag, or SHA to build from. Defaults to `main`.
3. Run it.

The workflow resolves the next version from GitHub Releases, bumps `package.json`, tags, pushes, and runs the multi-platform build + publish inline.

**How the next version is chosen:**

All stable kinds (`patch`, `minor`, `major`) are computed off the latest _stable_ release, ignoring any RCs in between.

- `kind=rc` + last tag was stable (e.g. `v1.3.14`) → `v1.3.15-rc.0`.
- `kind=rc` + active RC series (e.g. `v1.3.15-rc.2`) → `v1.3.15-rc.3`.
- `kind=patch` + latest stable `v1.3.14` → `v1.3.15` (regardless of any intermediate RCs).
- `kind=minor` + latest stable `v1.3.14` → `v1.4.0`.
- `kind=major` + latest stable `v1.3.14` → `v2.0.0`.

**Safety guarantees:**

- Stable releases are refused if the new version isn't strictly greater than the latest published stable. This is the only rule `electron-updater` actually needs — it compares semver within the `latest` channel, so a regressing stable is the one thing that breaks auto-update for fresh installs.
- Complete RC draft releases created by the release workflow are published before cutting a new tag only when the draft tag was built from the current release ref. Stale drafts are skipped so fixes cut a fresh RC instead of exposing old artifacts.
- If the latest RC tag exists but is still draft-only or missing its GitHub Release, the workflow resumes that tag only when it was built from the current release ref. Otherwise the next RC number is cut.
- RC numbering also considers release commits on `main`, so deleting a stale tag does not let a later cut reuse the same RC number.
- Off-main releases (when `ref` is not the tip of `main`) only push the tag. `main` is never mutated from a non-main ref, so you can safely release an older commit without polluting history.
- When `ref` is the tip of `main`, the workflow tries to fast-forward the version-bump commit onto `main`. If main requires pull requests, it leaves main unchanged and pushes only the release tag. Other push errors still stop the cut.

**Common scenarios:**

- **Normal release:** `kind=patch`, `ref=main`.
- **"A bad commit just landed on main, release the commit before it":** `kind=patch`, `ref=<good-sha>`. `main` is left alone; the tag points at the good SHA. Fix forward on `main` afterward.
- **One-off RC for a feature branch:** `kind=rc`, `ref=<branch-or-sha>`. Produces an RC tag that does not touch `main`.
- **Minor or major bump:** `kind=minor` or `kind=major`.

## Release Channels

The public Homebrew cask tracks stable desktop releases:

```bash
brew install --cask stablyai/orca/orca
```

Release candidates use a separate cask token:

```bash
brew install --cask stablyai/orca/orca@rc
```

The two casks conflict because both install `Orca.app`. Switch channels with a
normal `brew uninstall --cask` followed by the install for the other channel.
Do not use `--zap` unless you intentionally want to remove local Orca state.
