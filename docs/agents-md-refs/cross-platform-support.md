# Cross-Platform Support

Orca targets macOS, Linux, and Windows. Keep all platform-dependent behavior behind runtime checks:

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Never hardcode `e.metaKey`. Use a platform check (`navigator.userAgent.includes('Mac')`) to pick `metaKey` on Mac and `ctrlKey` on Linux/Windows. Electron menu accelerators should use `CmdOrCtrl`.
- **Shortcut labels in UI**: Display `⌘` / `⇧` on Mac and `Ctrl+` / `Shift+` on other platforms.
- **File paths**: Use `path.join` or Electron/Node path utilities — never assume `/` or `\`.
- **Windows terminal shells**: `--shell` picks the shell a terminal _is_; `--command` is typed into whatever shell the host spawned, so a shell choice routed through `command` silently becomes a child process.
- **Windows setup scripts**: the setup/issue-command runner is a `.cmd` batch file unless the script starts with a `#!` line — never derive that from the user's terminal-shell preference, and never launch a `.cmd` runner with a bare `cmd.exe /c` from a Git Bash pane (MSYS rewrites the `/c`).
- **Windows child processes**: start them through `runProcess`/`spawnProcess` from `@orca/process-host` — never `child_process` directly. It pins `windowsHide`, refuses `shell: true`, and encodes `.cmd`/`.bat` arguments so neither `CommandLineToArgvW` nor `cmd.exe` mangles them. Recognised npm/pnpm `.cmd` shims are resolved to their real target so the spawn skips `cmd.exe` entirely.
- **Ripgrep**: Orca bundles `rg` for every platform, WSL, and SSH remotes. Spawn it through `spawnBundledRipgrep` (main) or `resolveRelayRipgrepCommand` (relay), never a bare `'rg'` — Windows resolves a bare name in the spawn cwd before PATH. Don't add git/readdir fallbacks locally; the relay's chain exists only for hosts an upload never reached.
- **Windows process enumeration**: read the table through `src/main/windows/windows-process-table.ts`, never by forking `powershell.exe`.
- **Windows MSYS/Git Bash panes**: their children break away from the per-PTY job unless it is created without `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK`, and a `conpty.node` built before that fix passes every existing gate.
- **Windows daemon-host relocation**: the terminal daemon runs from a copy of the app runtime under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, which is what survives an auto-update.
- **macOS daemon launch**: packaged macOS runs the terminal daemon from a copy of the signed terminal host helper through launchd, so an update cannot sever its privacy grants. Before touching that copy, its cleanup, or the fork fallback, read [`macos-daemon-tcc-attribution.md`](./macos-daemon-tcc-attribution.md).
- **Windows EDR signal**: don't add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, `-EncodedCommand`, `cmd.exe /c` with escaped free text, per-operation interpreter spawning, or runtime `Add-Type` compilation without reviewing the EDR impact first — behavioural EDR scores each of those, and being signed does not clear them.
- **WSL commands**: build argv with `buildWslExecArgs` (always `--exec` — under `--`, `wsl.exe` expands `$name` in every argument and silently rewrites the script), and fence anything whose stdout you parse with `buildWslCapturedLoginShellCommand`, because the interactive login shell prints the distro banner to stdout.
- **Linux native modules**: keep the glibc floor at Ubuntu 20.04 / glibc 2.31. A module compiled from source on a newer runner can reference symbol versions absent on the floor and crash the app on startup. Packaging fails if a bundled native binary needs newer glibc.
