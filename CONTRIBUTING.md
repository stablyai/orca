# Contributing to Orca

Thanks for contributing to Orca.

## Before You Start

- Keep changes scoped to a clear user-facing improvement, bug fix, or refactor.
- Orca targets macOS, Linux, and Windows. Avoid platform-specific assumptions in shortcuts, labels, and file paths.
- For keyboard shortcuts, use runtime platform checks in renderer code and `CmdOrCtrl` in Electron menu accelerators.
- For shortcut labels, show `⌘` and `⇧` on macOS, and `Ctrl+` and `Shift+` on Linux and Windows.
- For file paths, use Node or Electron path utilities such as `path.join`.

## Local Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Branch Naming

Use a clear, descriptive branch name that reflects the change.

Good examples:

- `fix/ctrl-backspace-delete-word`
- `feat/shift-enter-newline`
- `chore/update-contributor-guide`

Avoid vague names like `test`, `misc`, or `changes`.

## Before Opening a PR

Run the same checks that CI runs:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Add high-quality tests for behavior changes and bug fixes. Prefer tests that would actually catch a regression, not shallow coverage that only exercises the happy path.

If your change affects UI or interaction behavior, verify it on the platforms it could impact.

## Pull Requests

Each pull request should:

- explain the user-visible change
- stay focused on a single topic when possible
- include screenshots or screen recordings for new UI or behavior changes
- include high-quality tests when behavior changes or bug fixes warrant them
- include a brief code review summary from your AI coding agent that explicitly checks cross-platform compatibility, plus a basic security audit summary
- mention any platform-specific behavior or testing notes

If there is no visual change, say that explicitly in the PR description.

## Release Process

Version bumps, tags, and releases are maintainer-managed. Do not include release version changes in a normal contribution unless a maintainer asks for them.
